A Repo where I document my haskell learning journey. 


## How to run code

- Open a terminal and enter the command `ghci`. THis opens the Haskell REPl
- Create a file ending in `.hs`
- Write your code
- Load the created code by running `:load <filename>`

Now you can call functions and investigate all expressions.

## REPl commands

```sh
# reload all modules
:r

# load module
:load <module-name>

# clear repl display
ctrl+l
```
